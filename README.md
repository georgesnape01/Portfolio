# Post-MSc Projects

| Title | Date | Task | Notable Tools | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🚢 [Titanic Survival](https://github.com/georgesnape01/titanic-survival) | Present | A binary classification problem with limited data points and features. Worked with various data formats including binary, continuous, text, and categorical variables. | Classical ML, Bagging, Boosting, Optuna |
| 📰 [Article Narratives](https://github.com/georgesnape01/article-narratives) | January 2025 | Hierarchical multilabel classification on a text dataset. The task involved predicting narratives first, followed by subnarratives with a limited number of articles. | Classical ML, Ensembling, NLP, Encoders, Decoders, Optuna |
| 😀 [Emotion Detection](https://github.com/georgesnape01/emotion-detection) | December 2024 | Multilabel classification for emotion detection using 3000 social media comments. | Classical ML, Encoders, Translation Models |
| 👁 Person Detection Webcam | November 2024 | Real-time object detection from webcam input to identify people and automate the process of sending email notifications when someone is detected. | YOLO, OpenCV, Email Automation |

# MSc Projects

| Title | Date | Task | Notable Tools | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 🧑‍🦲 [Therapy Outcomes (Dissertation)](https://github.com/georgesnape01/therapy-outcomes) | September 2024 | Explored binary classification with consideration of multiclass scenarios. The dataset had many variables, including binary, continuous, categorical, and text data, with significant missing and unclean data. Limited number of patients. | Classical ML, Ensembling, NLP, Encoders, Decoders, Optuna |
| ⛅ Weather Forecasting | February 2024 | Time series problem using around 500,000 records with 8 features to predict weather patterns such as humidity and temperature. | Classical ML, Baggging, Boosting, RNNs |
| 🚗 Car Accidents | February 2024 | Multiclass classification problem with 100,000 instances and 20 features aimed at predicting car accident severity. | Classical ML, Baggging, Boosting |
| ☑️ Booking Manager | October 2023 | A secure booking system aimed at handling booking creations, deletions, conflicts and availability whilst validating input. | Python |
