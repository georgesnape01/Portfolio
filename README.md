# Post MSc Projects

| Link | Date | Description | Notable Tools | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Titanic Survival](https://github.com/georgesnape01/titanic-survival) | Present | A binary classification problem with limited instances and features. Worked with various data formats including binary, continuous, text, and categorical variables. | Classical ML, Bagging, Boosting, Optuna |
| [Article Narratives](https://github.com/georgesnape01/article-narratives) | Dec 24 | Hierarchical multilabel classification on a text dataset. The task involved predicting narratives first, followed by subnarratives with a limited number of instances. | Classical ML, Ensembling, NLP, Encoders, Decoders, Optuna |

# MSc Data Science Projects

| Link | Date | Description | Notable Tools | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [Therapy Outcomes](https://github.com/georgesnape01/therapy-outcomes) | Sep 24 | Explored binary classification with consideration of multiclass scenarios. The dataset had many variables, including binary, continuous, categorical, and text data, with significant missing and unclean data. Limited in instances. | Classical ML, Ensembling, NLP, Encoders, Decoders, Optuna |
| [Weather Forecasting](https://github.com/georgesnape01/weather-forecasting) | Jan 24 |  | Classical ML, Baggging, Boosting, RNNs |
| [Car Accidents](https://github.com/georgesnape01/car-accidents) | Jan 24 |  | Classical ML, Baggging, Boosting |
